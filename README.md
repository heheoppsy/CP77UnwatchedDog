# CP77UnwatchedDog

CP77 simple byte patch for watchdog exitproc

Changes a conditional jump to a non conditional jump, avoiding watchdog exit process call

Only tested on CP77 version 2.12 and I don't know if this works on any other or if it will break anything

needlessly complex, this is just stripped version of my own patches but works
